Welcome to Rubin Rocks API Documentation
========================================

**Rubin Rocks**  is an online service intended to simplify the analysis of dynamical properties of near-Earth asteroids.
Instead of solving the gravitational multi-body problem over and over, Rubin Rocks pulls results from an existing data-base of 
high precision, long term numerical orbit simulations - a 1000 CPU year's worth of simulations to be exact - and  
presents results a *simple* and *intuitive* API. 

Check out the :ref:`API` section for further information.

A `web-based tool <https://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/rubinrocks/html/test.html>`_ is accessible through the 
`Astrodynamics and Planetary Exploration (APEX) <https://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/>`_ group at UIUC in collaboration with the DiRAC institute at the University of Washington. 

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
