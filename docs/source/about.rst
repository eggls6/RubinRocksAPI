About Rubin Rocks API
======================
Rubin Rocks Application  
An :ref:`API` query returns dynamical information for near-Earth Objects with a specific set of orbital parameters.
The results closest to the orbial element set provided by the user are returned. 

Dynamical Model
----------------
#. Greenstreet et al. 2012

The N-body code SWIFT-RMVS4 was used to create the near-Earth asteroid dynamical dataset. The default timestep was 6h,
which allowed high-speed encounters with Earth and Venus to be correctly resolved. 
A record of the orbital elements of all test particles was logged every 1000 years. 
The gravitational perturbations of Venusâ€“Neptune were included. 
Mercury was not present in these integrations for the purpose of the recomputation. 
Once a test particle reached the NEO region it was tracked until it either struck the Sun, 
struck a planet, travelled outside 19 au from the Sun, or the final integration time was reached. 
Test particles were monitored for 150 Myr in each asteroidal source region.
